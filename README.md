# RoguEngine (aka RE, Rogu, RoguE)

A free game engine for roguelike games (that possibly will be used only in one game)
Work in progress, there are a lot of things to do
Once was written on Python, but I decided that C++ will be more right variant

SFML Powered

## The Engine's Structure

The engine will include 3 parts (maybe more):

* Game Core
* Graphic Core
* Data Core (later)

## TODO (current priority)

* GUI
* Maps (pasting structures + rendering)
* Monsters
* Moving
* FOV and Pathfinding (for enemies)
* Combat
* Item system
* Saving
* XML as game data
